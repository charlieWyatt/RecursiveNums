# Overview
An esoteric representation of numbers.
The RecursiveNum project introduces a Python class designed for arithmetic operations using a recursive approach. This unique implementation encapsulates addition and multiplication within a class structure, demonstrating an alternative method to perform arithmetic operations with integers.

# Current Features
Recursive Addition and Multiplication: The class currently supports adding and multiplying integers recursively through the __add__ and __mul__ methods, respectively.
Return Value: A method to return the integer value after performing the recursive operation.
Esoteric Approach: This implementation serves as an educational tool to explore recursion in Python, showcasing how typical arithmetic operations can be approached differently.
